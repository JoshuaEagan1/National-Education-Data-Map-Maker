The `ELSI_excel_export_6376850743830017197307.xls` file was downloaded from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tableGenerator.aspx on sept 29, 2021 at 9:17AM. 

I selected the following feilds: Agency Name, State Name [District] Latest available year, Agency ID - NCES Assigned [District] Latest available year, and State Agency ID [District] 2019-20.

I then opened it, deleted text at the beginning (before the variable names) and end (after the last row) and saved it in the .xlsx file format as `internal to NCES crosswalk.xlsx`.
