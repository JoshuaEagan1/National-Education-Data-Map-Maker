## Continuous
A continuous variable is one that can take on a spectrum of different values 
(approximately infinite possibilities) such as temperature or the proportion
of the student body in each school district that scores proficient on an 
examination. Continuous variables are typically represented by numbers.

If you select "Continuous", your variable will be represented by a color spectrum.
For an example: if your variable is each district's average score on a state's academic achievement test, and you choose white and blue as your colors, districts will be colored whiter if they scored lower
on the state's achievement test and bluer if they scored higher on the state's achievement test.

## Discrete
A discrete variable is one that can only take a select few distinct values 
(usually a finite number) such as ethnicity, number of children for each family,
or each school district's accreditation status. Discrete variables can be 
represented by numbers or words.

If you select "Discrete", your variable will be represented by a set of colors of
your choosing (one for each unique value of your variable) For an example: if 
your variable represents the type of district (K-8, K-12, etc.) you will choose
colors corresponding to each unique value of your variable, and the color of each 
district will correspond to this color mapping.

## What about Variables that could be Either?
Some variables, such as the number of elementary schools in each district, could
be represented as continuous or discrete in this app. However, this variable would
likely be best represented as continuous because it takes on many different values.
If you wanted, you could choose "Discrete", but you would have to pick a different 
color to correspond to each unique possible value that this variable could take.

On the other hand, there are some variables that can only be discrete. In this app,
you must choose discrete if your variable is not numeric (if it is made up of letters
instead of numbers.) If you attempt to represent a non-numeric variable as continuous,
you will see an error message prompting you to select "Discrete".
